Welcome to my webpage, traveller.  Rest here, stay a while.

I am currently a Miller Fellow in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University, working on JWST data of distant quasars.

I WAS _the_ sixth year graduate student in _the_ Department of Astronomy at _the_ Ohio State University.  I worked on a whole lot of things during my time at (t)OSU! Most of my work during grad school has involved studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs).  This can be split up into two broad topics - the variability of the accretion disc and the changing-look phenomenon.  I've also worked on other projects focused on transients, namely work with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) search for failed supernovae (SNe) and tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN).
