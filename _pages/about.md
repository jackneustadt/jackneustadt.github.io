Welcome to my webpage, traveller.  Rest here, stay a while.

I am a Ph.D. astrophysicist with an expertise in the time-variable growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs).  

I am currently a Miller Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at The Johns Hopkins University.  

Before that, I was _the_ sixth year graduate student in _the_ Department of Astronomy at _the_ Ohio State University.  

I've had opportunities to work on a variety of topics, but most of my research has involved studying the accretion variability of SMBHs in active galactic nuclei (AGNs).  This work can be split up into two broad topics - the variability of the central accretion disk, and the changing-look phenomenon. 

My current work is a little different, examining velocity-stratified outflows in distant (redshift~2.5--3!) AGNs using 3D datacubes from JWST's NIRSpec IFU.  

I've also worked on other projects focused on transients, namely: the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) search for failed supernovae (SNe); and studies of tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). 

Check out my <a href="https://jackneustadt.github.io/publications/">Publications</a> page to see short summaries of all my first-author papers.  

For questions about my academic research, you can email me at my JHU or OSU email.  For other inquiries, you can contact me on LinkedIn or through my personal email, also found on LinkedIn.
