I am currently a Miller Fellow in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University. 

I WAS _the_ sixth year graduate student at the Department of Astronomy at the Ohio State University.  I have done work on a whole lot of things during my time here at (t)OSU!  Check me out on ADS to see all my papers.  You can also find my CV here. Most of my work during grad school has involved studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs).  This work can be split up into two broad topics - the variability of the accretion disc and the changing-look phenomenon.  I've also worked on other projects focused on transients, namely work with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) search for failed supernovae (SNe) and tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN).
