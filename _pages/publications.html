Here's a compilation of all my first-author papers.  For a full list of all papers I've worked on, check out my 
<a href="https://jackneustadt.github.io/cv/">CV</a> or look me up on <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=AND&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=author_facet_hier%3A%220%2FNeustadt%2C%20J%22&filter_property_fq_property=AND&filter_property_fq_property=property%3A%22refereed%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_author%7D&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_property%7D&fq_author=(author_facet_hier%3A%220%2FNeustadt%2C%20J%22)&fq_database=database%3A%20astronomy&fq_property=(property%3A%22refereed%22)&q=author%3A(%22neustadt%2C%20j%22)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADS</a>.

These papers are split into three categories: 

**Stochastic AGN Variability:** these papers are focused on understanding the random variability that is seen in all AGNs. This variability is attributed to thermal perturbations in the central accretion disk surrounding the SMBH, but the physical mechanisms driving those perturbations are unclear.  My work introduces a novel data transformation technique, using the observed data to create "maps" of the accretion disk, which would normally be unresolvable, in order to probe the unknown physical mechanisms driving the thermal perturbations we're so interested in understanding.  

**Transients around SMBHs:** these papers are focused on understanding various forms of transient variability that are seen in AGNs and around normally quiescent SMBHs.  Whereas all AGNs vary, not all of them show the large-amplitude flares and dimmings that are seen in these papers.  Rather than random perturbations in the accretion disk, these events are indicative of large changes in the overall accretion flow of the AGN (or SMBH).

**The deaths of massive stars:** All stars above a certain mass (~8 times the mass of our sun) will undergo core-collapse and "die".  But, not all of these stars die the same way.  The current understanding is that most explode as supernovae (SNe), creating a luminous transient that easily outshines its host galaxy.  But, some of these stars instead implode as failed SNe (also called "unnovae"), possibly producing a faint flare as they do so.  It's understandable, then, that the latter event is very hard to detect.  That's why you need a project like the Search for Failed Supernovae with the Large Binocular Telescope, which monitors millions of stars in nearby galaxies in order to find those handful of stars that suddenly disappear as failed SNe.  My papers focus on trying to detect these failed SNe, as well as using this unique dataset to study "successful" SNe.

I also include my first, first-author paper, written as an undergrad at Dartmouth, which focused on studying a supernova remnant.
