excerpt: 'The LBT search for failed SN is also just a great dataset for successful SNe.  The survey has been ongoing since 2008, and so we now have up to 15 years of archival observations that can be used to measure and constrain the pre-SN variability of the progenitor star.  We do exactly this for SN 2023ixf, finding no evidence for optical variability in our data.  We also put upper limits outbursts that we may have missed due to gaps in observation – namely, if the progenitor exceeded 5x its initial luminosity in an outburst, we would have been able to detect it because its long-lasting effects on the dust surrounding the progenitor.'

The progenitor of SN 2023ixf was an ~10^4.8 to 10^5.0 L⊙ star (~9 to 14M⊙ at birth) obscured by a dusty Mdot ≃ 10^−5 M⊙ yr^−1 wind with a visual optical depth of τ_V ≃ 13. This is required by the progenitor spectral energy distribution, the post-SN X-ray and H α luminosities, and the X-ray column density estimates. In Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) data spanning 5600 to 400 d before the supernova (SN), there is no evidence for optical variability at the level of ∼10^3 L⊙ in R band, roughly three times the predicted luminosity of the obscured progenitor. This constrains direct observation of any pre-SN optical outbursts where there are LBT observations. However, models of the effects of any pre-SN outburst on the dusty wind show that an outburst of essentially any duration exceeding ~5 times the luminosity of the progenitor would have detectable effects on the dust optical depth for decades. While the dust obscuration here is high, all red supergiants have dusty winds, and the destruction (or formation) of dust by even short-lived transients will always have long-term effects on the observed brightness of the star because changes in the dust optical depths after a luminous transient occur very slowly.
