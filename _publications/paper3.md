excerpt: 'I have also worked on finding failed supernova (SN) candidates with the OSU-co-owned Large Binocular Telescope (LBT).  Failed SNe are what happen when stars are too massive to explode as SN and instead implode into BHs.  We reported the discovery of a new candidate failed SN and updated the failed SN fraction based on our observations.'

We present updated results of the Large Binocular Telescope Search for Failed Supernovae. This search monitors luminous stars in 27 nearby galaxies with a current baseline of 11 yr of data. We re-discover the failed supernova (SN) candidate N6946-BH1 as well as a new candidate, M101-OC1. M101-OC1 is a blue supergiant that rapidly disappears in optical wavelengths with no evidence for significant obscuration by warm dust. While we consider other options, a good explanation for the fading of M101-OC1 is a failed SN, but follow-up observations are needed to confirm this. Assuming only one clearly detected failed SN, we find a failed SN fraction f = 0.16^{+0.23}_{-0.12} at 90 per cent confidence. We also report on a collection of stars that show slow (~decade), large amplitude (Î”L/L > 3) luminosity changes.
