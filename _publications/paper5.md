excerpt: 'We especially concentrated on the variability with respect to the exciting yet poorly understood “changing-look” phenomenon, where broad emission lines appear and/or disappear over the course of a few years.  While all AGNs are variable, this specific type of variability is extremely important in that it poses a direct challenge to the “unified model”, where the presence/absence of broad lines is thought to be a line-of-sight effect.  Moving back to NGC 5273, we report that the AGN changed-look at least once during the period from 2001 to 2022 (more tightly, between 2010 and 2014), and we claim that it may have done so multiple times based on its multi-wavelength variability.  However, due to lack of consistent spectroscopic observations, we cannot definitively say that the AGN changed-look more than once, though perhaps future observations will prove (or disprove!) our claim.   In any case, this study was a great experience and allowed me to personally handle data ranging from the near-infrared to hard X-rays, which is especially useful when AGNs emit at all these wavelengths.'

Abstract: NGC 5273 is a known optical and X-ray variable AGN. We analyse new and archival IR, optical, UV, and X-ray data in order to characterize its long-term variability from 2000-2022. At least one optical changing-look event occurred between 2011 and 2014 when the AGN changed from a Type 1.8/1.9 Seyfert to a Type 1. It then faded considerably at all wavelengths, followed by a dramatic but slow increase in UV/optical brightness between 2021 and 2022. Near-IR (NIR) spectra in 2022 show prominent broad Paschen lines that are absent in an archival spectrum from 2010, making NGC 5273 one of the few AGNs to be observed changing-look in the NIR. We propose that NGC 5273 underwent multiple changing-look events between 2000 and 2022 - starting as a Type 1.8/1.9, NGC 5273 changes-look to a Type 1 temporarily in 2002 and again in 2014, reverting back to a Type 1.8/1.9 by 2005 and 2017, respectively. In 2022, it is again a Type 1 Seyfert. We characterize the changing-look events and their connection to the dynamic accretion and radiative processes in NGC 5273 and propose that the variable luminosity (and thus, Eddington ratio) of the source is changing how the broad-line region (BLR) reprocesses the continuum emission.
